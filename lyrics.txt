Uh
Yeah
It’s Big Man Callum
We rollin’?
Yeah!
Let’s go!
Yo! This year sucks, bro
It’s really bad
People so stupid
Like bro, just say inside
It ain’t ‘ard
Just do it
Doing all the homework on my PC
I own a Mac
Not a PC
Don’t tell anyone though bro
It’s so hard
Someone please help
I hope it’s over soon
Going back to school in September
Jokin’
That won’t happen
Second wave o’ Covid, bro
Yeah man!
What is ‘appnin’?
I can’t rap
Or sing
But I’m tryin’
That’s all that matters bro
It’s hard
Someone help me
I hope it’s over soon
Anyway
That’s Big Man Callum done fam
He’s done
He’s goin’
He’s goin’
He goin’ straight to nowhere
Get it?
Because everythings shut
I’m so funny
I need a haircut
Peace!
